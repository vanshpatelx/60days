# 60-Day Code Challenge & Problem Solving Tracker


## ðŸ“… Challenge Progress

### Day 1 - 8 Aug 24 (Array)

1. [Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/)
   - **Logic**: First thing here is it's continuous, so we directly go on sliding window; otherwise, we have to check every case in DP.
   - **Solution**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/vanshpatelx/60days/blob/main/day1/MaxPointsCard.java)

2. [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
   - **Logic**: Making a new array. Adding all non-zero elements and filling with zero.
   - **Solution**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/vanshpatelx/60days/blob/main/day1/MoveZero)

3. [Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-three-parts-with-equal-sum/)
   - **Logic**: The catch is where we don't know about the sum, but here we know that, so directly sum it, divide by 3, and find the index.
   - **Solution**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/vanshpatelx/60days/blob/main/day1/PartsEqual3Array)

4. [Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)
   - **Logic**: First, go to the nearest Zero, then take two pointersâ€”one on less than zero and another on zero or biggerâ€”and add the smallest element.
   - **Solution**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/vanshpatelx/60days/blob/main/day1/SquareSortedArray)
